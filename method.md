# My Auto Service

## Executive Summary

*The project we are wanting to develop will help revolutionize the automotive service industry. This application will provide direct access for the customer to speak directly with the service technician involved with servicing their vehicle. Essentially, lifting the veil over the true cost of service while providing transparency and better understanding for the customers involved. A program like this will ease customers doubts as well as generate more business for the service department.*

## Business Objectives

*As we know, what's the first thing that comes to mind when we have to go in to service our vehicles?
"I hope it won't be a waste of money...", "How do I know if they're telling the truth..", "Am I really getting a complimentary full car service with my maintenance?".
Our objective here is to ease consumers concern when it comes down to their vehicles. We can achieve this by:

1. Creating a platform where the customer, service advisor, and technician can communicate openly on concerning issues.
2. Allow the functionality to post videos and pictures that can be shared between everyone involved.
3. Customers can receive notifications that their car is ready for pickup, or if a new issue has been found and needs customer approval before completing.*

## Background

*This project was created because of the growing amount of customer satisfaction issues and complaints towards service departments nationwide.
By providing transparency and open communications with the customer, we predict the satisfaction surveys will improve as well as generating more revenue for any given service department.*

## Scope

*This project will include:
Chat functionality between customers and service advisors and technicians.
Ability to upload videos and pictures to help identify key issues and concerns
Push notifications to alert customers when vehicle is ready for pickup or a new issue is uncovered.*

## Functional requirements

*Socket.io - Main chat function built using this is to handle  everything including the sending of videos, images, and audio files.
NodeJs - backend server. It is lightweight and perfect for scalable projects. Also since the primary programming language will be javascript for this project, it makes sense to use NodeJs.
AngularJs or Ionic framework - both are javascript frontend frameworks and are both great at breaking up code into smaller modules for development and testing purposes. Which will make the application have cross-platform support.
MongoDB - NoSQL database to store all the conversations between users.*


## Personnel requirements

*UI/UX Designers - we will need 1 - 2 people for this role. This will help speed up development process.
Full Stack Javascript Engineers - We will need at least 2 people. This will help speed up development process.
QA testers - 1 person can assume the role of QA.*

## Delivery schedule

*Phase 1 - Design.
    Here we will want to see a visual of where all of the user capabilities will take place. We want it to be arranged in a certain way that will be aesthetically pleasing for the users.

Phase 2 - Implementation.
    Designers will work with the Engineers to craft a working prototype for demonstrating amongst the team and PM. This will help to determine if there are any issues with the design of the app.

Phase 3 - Testing.
    The project will then be handed off to the QA tester to look for faults in our application and bring the findings to the dev team for fixing.

Phase 4 - Beta testing.
    We will release the app to a small focus group to make sure the user experience and expectations are where we were hoping it to be.

Phase 5 - Deployment
    The application will finally be ready for release to the general public.

Phase 6 - Maintenance.
    We will have ongoing support and maintenance as the application grows.*

## Other requirements

*The design aspect will be following the guidelines set by Google's Material Design. That way it will be compatible with most browsers and devices.*

## Assumptions

*We will be using Socket.io for the chat functionality, AngularJs as the frontend framework along with Google Material for the design of the app, and NodeJs/MongoDB for the backend.*

## Limitations

*Being that we are working with a small team on this project, our cost will be relatively low. But our completion time will be right around average for application rollout.*

## Risks

*If there is a possibility of a major user feature that may have some issues being implemented. We would of already accounted for this by allowing an extra week in the production cycle to work out any fixes or redesign our approach to the solution.*
